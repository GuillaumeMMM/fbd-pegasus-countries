            <p>In July 2021, the Pegasus Project <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lesoir.be/385062/article/2021-07-20/charles-michel-et-emmanuel-macron-selectionnes-comme-cibles-pour-le-logiciel'>reveals</a> that a Moroccan client of NSO Group selected the phone number of then Prime Minister of Belgium Charles Michel in 2019 for potential surveillance (Morocco denied this finding). The phone of his father, Belgian politician Louis Michel, was also selected for surveillance, likely by the same client.</p><p>In September, Belgium’s intelligence agency (SGRS) officially confirms the Pegasus Project findings. After France’s, it is the second intelligence agency to do so. The SGRS also draws up a list of probable victims and finds that the phones of Belgium journalist Peter Verlinden and his wife Marie Bamutese have been targeted with Pegasus, likely on the initiative of Rwanda, Belgian media <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lesoir.be/395505/article/2021-09-17/un-journaliste-belge-cible-par-le-logiciel-espion-pegasus'>Le Soir</a> and <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.knack.be/nieuws/pegasus-spyware-iphone-van-journalist-peter-verlinden-gehackt/'>Knack</a> reveal as part of the Pegasus Project.</p><p>In November, <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2021/11/23/projet-pegasus-un-militant-de-l-autodetermination-du-sahara-occidental-espionne-en-belgique_6103305_4408996.html'>Le Monde</a>, Knack and <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lesoir.be/408089/article/2021-11-23/une-nouvelle-victime-belge-du-logiciel-espion-pegasus'>Le Soir</a> report that Saharan activist Mahjoub Mleiha was a victim of Pegasus on Belgian soil and that he intends to file a complaint in Belgium (according to our information, the complaint has not yet been filed).</p><p>In a New Yorker investigation from April 2022, NSO Group co-founder Shalev Hulio <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/how-democracies-spy-on-their-citizens'>says</a> that Belgian law enforcement uses Pegasus but “won’t admit it” (in response to the allegations, the Belgian federal police says it respects “a legal framework as to the use of intrusive methods in private life”).
