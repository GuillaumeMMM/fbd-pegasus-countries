            <p>In 2019, Ghanaian media outlets <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2019/07/01/why-did-the-nca-in-ghana-acquire-israeli-company-nsos-pegasus/'>reported</a> that the National Communications Authority (NCA) of Ghana bought Pegasus and that it paid $4 million for “cyber security equipment” to a local representative of NSO Group. According to the Auditor-General of Ghana, cited by the media, the NCA received the machine but not the software.</p><p>In 2020, three former government officials of Ghana were <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.timesofisrael.com/ghana-jails-3-ex-government-officials-for-spyware-deal-with-israels-nso-group/'>sentenced</a> to jail in Accra for having dealt with the purchase of Pegasus with NSO Group. It was the first time officials were jailed for doing business with NSO Group.</p><p>In November 2021, Le Monde <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2021/11/24/pegasus-apple-revele-l-existence-de-dizaines-de-nouvelles-victimes-dans-le-monde_6103461_4408996.html'>reported</a> that Apple had sent notifications to dozens of individuals who it suspected had been targeted with spyware, including a journalist in Ghana.</p><p>In January 2022, an Israeli media outlet <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://13tv.co.il/item/news/abroad/gahna-nso-pegasus-902824149/'>reported</a> that the Ghanaian government purchased Pegasus ahead of the 2017 elections. According to an investigation by TV show Hamakor, which had access to the contract, Ghana’s telecommunications authority allegedly purchased the software but never got access to it. Instead, Pegasus was allegedly acquired by Ghana’s National Security Council for the purpose of spying on 25 political rivals of the government just months before the 2017 elections, according to Ghana's internal intelligence agency, as cited by the Israeli media outlet. The agency had reportedly launched an investigation into the purchase and alleged use of the spyware. According to Hamakor, the agreement between NSO Group and Ghana was never finalized. NSO Group told the investigative show that Pegasus was never operational in Ghana.</p>
