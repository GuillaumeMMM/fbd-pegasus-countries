            <h1>Territories of Palestine</h1>
            <p>In 2020, Citizen Lab <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/'>reported</a> that the phone of Palestinian Al Jazeera journalist Tamer Almisshal had been infected with Pegasus earlier the same year, along with 35 other Al Jazeera staffers. According to the forensics lab, some of the attacks were ordered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>In November 2021, four months after the Pegasus Project, rights organization Front Line Defenders <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/press-release-front-line-defenders-investigation-finds-pegasus-spyware-6-palestinian-hrd-phones'>found</a> that the phones of six Palestinian human rights defenders had been infected with Pegasus. Front Line Defenders, Amnesty International and Citizen Lab, who peer-reviewed the work, said they were unable to identify with certainty the identity of the client who ordered the infection of the phones. The organizations noted, however, that four of the six identified victims were affiliated with Palestinian NGOs that were labeled "terrorist" organizations by the state of Israel shortly after their phones were infected and days before the report was published, and that Israel’s designation of the organizations as “terrorist” had been widely criticized by the international community.</p>
