            <p>In 2016, the New York Times published a piece <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/technology/nso-group-how-spy-tech-firms-let-governments-see-everything-on-a-smartphone.html'>detailing</a> how much Israeli company NSO Group would charge for its spyware Pegasus: a $500,000 installation fee, and $650,000 to spy on 10 iPhones or 10 Androids.</p><p>In 2018, a Qatari citizen and Mexican journalists and activists targeted using Pegasus sued NSO Group in Cyprus and in Israel, accusing the company of actively participating in illegal spying. According to the Associated Press, their lawyers were <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://apnews.com/article/north-america-lawsuits-ap-top-news-london-spyware-9bdbbfe0c8a2407aac14a1e995659de4'>targeted</a> by Black Cube (NSO Group co-founder Shalev Hulio later <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/how-democracies-spy-on-their-citizens'>acknowledged</a> to The New Yorker that “there was one involvement of Black Cube” for the lawsuit in Cyprus but denied NSO Group had hired Black Cube for other lawsuits).</p><p>In the aftermath of the publication of the Pegasus Project in July 2021, and according to unnamed sources cited by several Israeli media outlets, the Israeli government <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/21/israel-creating-task-force-to-manage-response-to-pegasus-project'>set up</a> a task force to manage the fallout of the revelations. NSO Group <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.amnesty.fr/liberte-d-expression/actualites/pegasus-quelles-avancees-depuis-les-revelations-surveillance-logiciel-espion'>denied</a> all allegations from the project and said Pegasus was being used legally. On July 22, the Israeli parliament <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/22/israel-examine-spyware-export-rules-should-be-tightened-nso-group-pegasus'>announced</a> it would set up an inquiry commission to investigate the allegations of misuse of Pegasus. On July 25, French president Emmanuel Macron, who was listed as a potential target by clients of NSO Group, <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.amnesty.fr/liberte-d-expression/actualites/pegasus-quelles-avancees-depuis-les-revelations-surveillance-logiciel-espion'>asked</a> Israel to investigate the Pegasus revelations. On July 28, Israeli defense officials <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-ministry-officials-visit-nso-group-in-first-probe-following-spy-expose/'>visited</a> NSO's offices as part of a government investigation into the company's actions. On July 29, according to an employee’s testimony to NPR, NSO Group temporarily <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://text.npr.org/1022409865'>blocked</a> several government clients as the company investigated possible misuse.</p><p>In November 2021, four months after the Pegasus Project, rights organization Front Line Defenders <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/press-release-front-line-defenders-investigation-finds-pegasus-spyware-6-palestinian-hrd-phones'>found</a> that the phones of six Palestinian human rights defenders had been infected with Pegasus. Front Line Defenders, Amnesty International and Citizen Lab, who peer-reviewed the work, said they were unable to identify with certainty the identity of the client who ordered the infection of the phones. The organizations noted, however, that four of the six identified victims were affiliated with Palestinian NGOs that were labeled "terrorist" organizations by the state of Israel shortly after their phones were infected and days before the report was published, and that Israel’s designation of the organizations as “terrorist” had been widely criticized by the international community.</p><p>The same month, the U.S. administration <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/business/nso-group-spyware-blacklist.html'>blacklisted</a> NSO Group. The same month, human rights organization Front Line Defenders <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/statement-report/statement-targeting-palestinian-hrds-pegasus'>reported</a> that the phones of 6 Palestinian human rights defenders had been hacked with Pegasus, the new CEO of NSO Group <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2021/11/11/affaire-pegasus-a-peine-nomme-le-nouveau-pdg-de-nso-group-demissionne_6101741_4408996.html'>resigns</a> just 12 days after his nomination was announced and Moody's <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://fr.timesofisrael.com/le-nso-group-en-grande-difficulte-apres-sa-mise-sur-liste-noire-aux-etats-unis/'>downgraded</a> NSO Group’s credit rating to “poor,” deeming that the company was at a very high risk of breaching its debt agreement. Israel’s defense ministry also <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3923361,00.html'>released</a> a new, shortened list of countries to which Israeli firms are allowed to export cybersecurity tools, reducing it from 102 countries to 37.</p><p>In early December, NSO Group <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://fr.timesofisrael.com/nso-enquete-sur-le-possible-espionnage-de-diplomates-americains-via-pegasus/'>announced</a> it had opened an investigation after The New York Times <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/world/africa/uganda-hack-pegasus-spyware.html'>reported</a> Pegasus was used to spy on US diplomats in Uganda.</p><p>In January 2022, Israeli newspaper Calcalist <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3927410,00.html'>reported</a> that the Israeli police had allegedly used Pegasus without judicial supervision or legal permission to spy on mayors, former government employees and leaders of protests against former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Following the revelations, Israeli legislators called for a parliamentary investigation, Israel’s ministry of public security and then-Prime Minister Naftali Bennett <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-02-07/ty-article/israel-police-used-nsos-pegasus-spyware-against-top-govt-officials-journalists-and-activists/0000017f-e7ff-da9b-a1ff-efff62400000'>pledged</a> an investigation and the State Comptroller of Israel said he would expand his ongoing investigation into the use of surveillance technology by law enforcement to include the latest Pegasus allegations. A week after the Calcalist revelations, the chairman of NSO Group <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/chairman-israeli-spyware-firm-nso-says-he-has-stepped-down-2022-01-25/'>stepped down</a> from his position but said his departure was planned months ago and was unrelated to the scandal.</p><p>That same month, Israeli newspaper Haaretz <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-u-s-venture-capital-firm-in-talks-to-buy-israel-s-infamous-spyware-maker-nso-1.10565909'>revealed</a> that NSO Group was in negotiations to sell the company to a US venture capital firm in the aftermath of being blacklisted by the US administration. The New York Times also <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/magazine/nso-group-israel-spyware.html'>disclosed</a> that the state of Israel provided a Pegasus license to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates during the negotiation process of the Abraham Accords, a 2020 diplomatic pact to normalize relations between Israel and the Arab countries.</p><p>On February 7, Calcalist <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3928830,00.html'>reported</a> that the Israeli police allegedly had used Pegasus without a warrant against a former editor-in-chief of Israeli news outlet Walla, Walla journalists, chief executives, activists, political advisers and Netanyahu’s son Avner Netanyahu, among others. (Calcalist's revelations were <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.timesofisrael.com/nso-files-defamation-lawsuit-against-calcalist-over-reports-on-police-use-of-spyware/'>denied</a> by NSO Group, which sued the newspaper. Members of the Israeli government, such as Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar, also contended the Calcalist findings and, according to an interim report, <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.timesofisrael.com/saar-report-on-illegal-nso-spyware-use-was-incorrect-no-need-for-state-inquiry/'>found</a> "no indication" of hacking using Pegasus. Calcalist's revelations were also criticized by the Israeli media, which noted the lack of clear evidence provided by the business newspaper. Calcalist later <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-03-14/ty-article/.premium/israels-calcalist-daily-stands-by-nso-reporting-admits-there-may-have-been-errors/00000180-5b8c-d615-a9bf-dfdc3f940000'>said</a> it stood by its revelations, while admitting that there may have been mistakes regarding the spyware’s victims.)</p><p>In the aftermath of Calcalist’s reports, Israel <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-02-07/ty-article/.premium/israel-polices-spyware-scandal-politicians-demand-commission-of-inquiry/0000017f-e7d8-df5f-a17f-ffde9b610000'>announced</a> it would investigate its police force’s alleged use of Pegasus. A couple of days later, thousands of people <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/02/netanyahu-rallies-supporters-pegasus-protests'>gathered</a> in Tel Aviv to demand the establishment of an inquiry commission into the allegations that the police illegally spied on witnesses in the trial of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu.</p><p>In August 2022, a Justice Ministry report on the use of spyware by the Israeli police <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.timesofisrael.com/probe-finds-israel-police-did-not-unlawfully-hack-phones-of-politicians-activists/'>found</a> that the latter had acted largely in accordance with the law and that it had not hacked the phones of most names included in the list published by Calcalist, but that it had repeatedly exceeded the bounds of cyber warrants.
