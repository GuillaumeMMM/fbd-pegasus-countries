Members of the Israeli government, such as Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar, also contended the Calcalist findings and, according to an interim report, <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.timesofisrael.com/saar-report-on-illegal-nso-spyware-use-was-incorrect-no-need-for-state-inquiry/'>found</a> "no indication" of hacking using Pegasus.
