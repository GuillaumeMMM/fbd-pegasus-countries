The investigation also <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/19/hotel-rwanda-activist-daughter-pegasus-surveillance'>reveals</a> that the cell phone belonging to Carine Kanimba, the daughter of an outspoken critic of President Paul Kagame, was infected by the spyware in Belgium on a Belgian phone number.</p><p>In September, Belgian media outlets Le Soir and Knack <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lesoir.be/395505/article/2021-09-17/un-journaliste-belge-cible-par-le-logiciel-espion-pegasus'>reveal</a> that the Belgian secret services (SGRS) found probable traces of Pegasus infection in the phones of Belgian journalist Peter Verlinden and his Belgian wife of Rwandan origin Marie Bamutese.</p><p>Just one year after the publication of Project Pegasus, the consortium coordinated by Forbidden Stories reveals the infection of another close relative of Paul Rusesabagina, his nephew Jean-Paul Nsonzrumpa, who lives in Belgium. According to the analyses conducted by Citizen Lab, his phone was infected several times in October and November 2020.</p>
