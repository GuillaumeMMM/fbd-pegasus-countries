            <h1>Tunisia</h1>
            <p>In August 2021, shortly after the Pegasus Project, Middle East Eye <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pegasus-tunisia-ghannouchi-saudi-arabia-targeted'>reported</a> that an entity in Saudi Arabia had selected the speaker of Tunisia’s parliament and head of the Ennahda party Rached Ghannouchi for potential surveillance with Pegasus in 2019. Ghannouchi’s number was found in the list of 50,000 numbers that was part of the Pegasus Project. Ennahda condemned the revelations and called on the Tunisian authorities to open an investigation into the allegations and take an official stance on the matter.</p><p>Drawing on analysis from Citizen Lab and Amnesty International's Security Lab, media organizations from the Pegasus consortium <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/20/un-backed-investigator-into-possible-yemen-war-crimes-targeted-by-spyware'>reported</a> in December 2021 that former Tunisian minister Kamel Jendoubi was targeted with Pegasus in August 2019, likely by Saudi Arabia, during a time in which he was chairman of a UN-backed group investigating possible war crimes in Yemen.</p>
