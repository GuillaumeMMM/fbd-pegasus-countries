            <p>In July 2021, the Pegasus Project <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/21/uae-linked-to-listing-of-hundreds-of-uk-phones-in-pegasus-project-leak'>reveals</a> that more than 400 UK phone numbers were selected between 2017 and 2019 for potential surveillance using Pegasus by government clients. According to the investigation, the principal government responsible for selecting UK numbers appears to be the United Arab Emirates, a traditional British ally. The investigation also <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/02/princess-latifa-campaigner-david-haigh-phone-compromised-pegasus-spyware'>finds</a> the first confirmed British victim of a Pegasus infection, human rights activist and lawyer David Haigh. The consortium finds that his phone has been successfully infected with the spyware, likely by Dubai because of the activist’s connection with Princess Latifa, another Pegasus victim.</p><p>Following the revelations, British MPs <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2021-07-21/debates/DE7C321B-415A-4AEA-8691-08E673DACB97/Spyware'>question</a> the government. A few months later, in October 2021, a British court <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/06/pegasus-dubai-princess-haya-court-ruling/'>confirms</a> the findings of the Pegasus Project, namely that Princess Haya and her close circle were targeted for surveillance with the spyware after she fled Dubai. In reaction to the court ruling, NSO Group <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/08/nso-pegasus-spyware-can-no-longer-target-uk-phone-numbers'>excludes</a> UK numbers (numbers with the country code +44) from the numbers that its clients can target.</p><p>In November 2021, a couple of days after the United States blacklists NSO Group, 10 British MPs and peers <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/11/no-10-accused-failing-act-states-accused-nso-pegasus-spyware-abuses-boris-johnson'>call</a> on recently-resigned Prime Minister Boris Johnson to, among other things, impose sanctions on the Israeli firm.</p><p>In April 2022, Citizen Lab <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://citizenlab.ca/2022/04/uk-government-officials-targeted-pegasus/'>reports</a> that it found several suspected instances of Pegasus infections on a device connected to 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister’s office, and to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 2020 and 2021, and that it had informed the government of the United Kingdom. The laboratory connects the suspected infections of the device at 10 Downing Street to an operator that it believes to be the United Arab Emirates. A British official later <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/how-democracies-spy-on-their-citizens'>confirms</a> to The New Yorker that the “network was compromised,” but without specifying the spyware used.</p><p>The same month, Middle East Eye <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pegasus-spyware-uk-targets-threatens-lawsuits-nso-uae-saudi-arabia'>reports</a> that three UK-based activists, Yahya Assiri, Anas Altikriti and Mohammed Kozbar, have notified NSO Group, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of their intention to sue them in the United Kingdom over allegations that the two countries spied on them with Pegasus. The legal action is launched the same month.</p>
