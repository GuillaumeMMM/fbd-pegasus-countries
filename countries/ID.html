            <p>In September 2022, Reuters <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-senior-indonesian-officials-targeted-by-spyware-last-year-sources-2022-09-30/'>reported</a> that more than a dozen senior Indonesian government and military officials were targeted with a form of spyware in 2021, including the country’s coordinating minister for economic affairs Airlangga Hartarto. Six of them told the news outlet that they had received a message from Apple telling them they were being "targeted by state-sponsored attackers." (A spokesperson for Airlangga’s ministry told Reuters the minister did not receive any notification from Apple about the attempted hack on his official email account.) They were targeted using ForcedEntry, a zero-click exploit previously <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/'>identified</a> by Citizen Lab as used by NSO Group to install Pegasus, but Reuters wrote that it was unable to identify who made the spyware used in the attacks.</p><p>A consortium of Indonesian media outlets <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://magz.tempo.co/read/law/40698/who-use-pegasus-in-indonesia'>reported</a> <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.suara.com/news/2023/06/12/060000/melacak-jejak-bawah-tangan-pegasus-senjata-pembungkam-massa-di-indonesia'>in</a> <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://jaring.id/jejak-alat-sadap-israel-di-indonesia/'>June</a> <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://kabar24.bisnis.com/read/20230612/15/1664382/desas-desus-terendusnya-pegasus-pengintai-asal-israel'>2023</a> that Pegasus has been used in Indonesia since 2018. According to their sources, several state agencies, among them the State Intelligence Agency (BIN), have been using the spyware in Indonesia. The news outlets also traced back product deliveries of NSO Group’s holding, Q Cyber Technologie Sarl, to a company owned by the family of the wife of the industry minister of Indonesia in 2020.</p>
