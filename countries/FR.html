            <p>In July 2021, the Pegasus Project <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.francetvinfo.fr/politique/gouvernement-d-edouard-philippe/pegasus-le-gouvernement-et-toute-la-classe-politique-francaise-dans-le-viseur-du-maroc_4709413.html'>reveals</a> that French president Emmanuel Macron, his former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and 14 other French ministers were selected by Moroccan secret services for potential surveillance with Pegasus. It is the first time an investigation reveals the potential use of NSO Group’s spyware against a head of state while in office. Many French politicians are also on the list.</p><p>A few days after the revelations, French authorities <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/aug/02/pegasus-spyware-found-on-journalists-phones-french-intelligence-confirms'>find</a> that the phones of three French journalists identified in the Pegasus Project were infected with the spyware, the first time an official authority confirms the technical results of the Pegasus Project. According to Mediapart, French authorities also later <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/230921/affaire-pegasus-les-telephones-de-cinq-ministres-infectes'>identify</a> the "presence of suspicious markers" in the phones of five ministers in office.</p><p>Following the Pegasus Project revelations, French president Macron changes his phone, convenes an emergency meeting on cybersecurity and engages in diplomatic discussions with the government of Israel, which will continue over the following months. France asks the Israeli government to exclude French phone codes from the numbers that can be targeted/to protect French numbers (the French Minister of the Army <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2021/09/24/florence-parly-la-fiabilite-americaine-n-est-plus-aussi-grande-que-par-le-passe_6095825_3210.html'>told</a> Le Monde at the time that Israeli authorities had replied that “this would be the case”).</p><p>In October and November 2021, several media report on the French government’s alleged project of buying Pegasus. French radio Europe 1 first <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.europe1.fr/politique/info-europe-1-la-france-a-failli-acheter-le-logiciel-espion-israelien-pegasus-4069632'>claims</a> that France had been in discussions with NSO Group before the French head of state allegedly cut in in favor of a “no” six months before the Pegasus Project was published. MIT Technology Review in turn <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/11/23/1040509/france-macron-nso-in-crisis-sanctions/'>states</a> that the French government was in the process of acquiring the spyware but that negotiations were ended when it was revealed that French ministers could be potential victims of Pegasus (the government denies having ever been in the process of buying the spyware). Le Monde finally <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2021/11/26/malgre-les-approches-de-nso-group-la-france-a-choisi-a-la-fin-de-2020-de-ne-pas-acheter-le-logiciel-espion-pegasus_6103783_4408996.html'>writes</a> that France was approached by NSO Group in 2019 and 2020, but that the government officially refused to sign a contract with the company at the end of 2020.</p><p>French prosecutors open an investigation on July 20, 2021. It is entrusted to an investigating judge, AFP <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/logiciel-espion-pegasus-l-enquete-en-france-confiee-a-un-juge-d-instruction-20220701'>reports</a> in early July 2022. The investigation is opened "against X" and covers a large number of potential offenses, according to the agency. Unlike a prosecutor, in France, an investigating judge is independent of the ministry of Justice.</p>
