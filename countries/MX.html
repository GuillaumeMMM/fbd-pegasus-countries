            <p>The first of NSO’s known clients, the Mexican government already uses Pegasus in 2011. At least three Mexican federal agencies have purchased NSO’s spyware. The Mexican government has said that it spent more than $160 million on Pegasus over a decade.</p><p>In 2016, Canadian research laboratory Citizen Lab <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/'>reports</a> that Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera was targeted by Pegasus, the first known journalist victim of the spyware.</p><p>In June 2017, The New York Times and Citizen Lab <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/world/americas/mexico-spyware-anticrime.html'>reveal</a> that Mexican journalists, anti-corruption activists and human rights lawyers were targeted with Pegasus, which had been acquired by the Mexican government. A couple of days later, Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/world/americas/mexico-pena-nieto-hacking-pegasus.html'>acknowledges</a> the government had purchased NSO Group’s spyware and promises an investigation into the misuse of the spyware.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2019, Citizen Lab <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://citizenlab.ca/2019/03/nso-spyware-slain-journalists-wife/'>finds</a> additional evidence of targeting with Pegasus against Mexican journalists, activists, researchers and lawyers, with a total of 25 individuals in Mexico known to have been abusively targeted with Pegasus.</p><p>In 2020, The Cartel Project led by Forbidden Stories <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://forbiddenstories.org/spying-on-mexican-journalists-investigating-the-lucrative-market-of-cyber-surveillance/'>discloses</a> that Mexican journalist Jorge Carrasco was targeted with NSO’s spyware in 2016.</p><p>In July 2021, the Pegasus Project <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://forbiddenstories.org/journaliste/carmen-aristegui/'>reveals</a> that three people close to Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui were targeted with Pegasus and that three others had been selected for potential surveillance (the consortium was unable to analyze the phones they were using at the time). The investigation also finds that former president Felipe Calderón, at least 25 Mexican journalists  and at least 50 people around Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, among others, were selected for potential surveillance. Overall, the Pegasus Project identifies more than 15,000 Mexican numbers selected by Mexico for potential surveillance using Pegasus.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Pegasus Project investigation, President López Obrador commits to make all information on Pegasus public, including contracts signed with NSO Group and the results of espionage against public figures. In November however, the government <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://aristeguinoticias.com/0812/mexico/gobierno-argumenta-seguridad-nacional-para-no-entregar-informacion-sobre-software-espia-pegasus-reforma/'>cites</a> “national security” as the reason for not releasing information on Pegasus. One year later, no official document from Mexico on Pegasus has been made public.</p><p>In August 2021, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Office in Mexico of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights calls on the Mexican government to “effectively sanction” the misuse of Pegasus.</p><p>In November 2021, Mexico <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://aristeguinoticias.com/0811/mexico/detiene-fgr-a-uno-de-los-involucrados-en-espionaje-con-pegasus/'>arrests</a> a technician working for a private firm accused of spying on journalist Carmen Aristegui using Pegasus. It is the first arrest in Mexico related to the Pegasus scandal.</p>
