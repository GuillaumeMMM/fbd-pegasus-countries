            <p>In 2019, Amnesty International <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2019/10/morocco-human-rights-defenders-targeted-with-nso-groups-spyware/'>uncovers</a> that the phones of two Moroccan human rights defenders, Maati Monjib and Abdessadak El Bouchattaoui, were targeted with Pegasus starting from at least 2017. The NGO <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/06/nso-spyware-used-against-moroccan-journalist/'>finds</a> in 2020 that the phone of Moroccan journalist Omar Radi was also infected with Pegasus.</p><p>In July 2021, the Pegasus Project <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://daraj.com/en/76202/'>reveals</a> that what is believed to be a Moroccan operator has selected more than 10,000 numbers in several countries for potential surveillance with Pegasus. Consortium members also <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lemonde.fr/projet-pegasus/article/2021/07/18/au-maroc-comme-en-france-des-journalistes-mis-sous-surveillance-avec-le-logiciel-pegasus_6088654_6088648.html'>report</a> that several Moroccan journalists critical to the government were selected as potential Pegasus targets. Among them are <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://forbiddenstories.org/journaliste/taoufik-bouachrine/'>Taoufik Bouachrine</a> and <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://forbiddenstories.org/journaliste/soulaiman-raissouni-2/'>Souleimane Raissouni</a>, two Moroccan newspaper editors who are currently in jail on charges such as sexual assault and rape. These charges, according to human rights organizations, were brought against them in an effort to silence independent journalism in Morocco. The Pegasus investigation also <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lemonde.fr/projet-pegasus/article/2021/07/18/au-maroc-comme-en-france-des-journalistes-mis-sous-surveillance-avec-le-logiciel-pegasus_6088654_6088648.html'>identifies</a> several French individuals, including activist Claude Mangin and journalists Lenaïg Bredoux and Edwy Plenel, whose phones were successfully infected with Pegasus, likely by a Moroccan operator, and several Moroccan individuals listed as potential targets, including King Mohammed VI, other members of the Moroccan royal family, their entourage and then-prime minister of Morocco Saad-Eddine El-Othmani.</p><p>Morocco “categorically” <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lemonde.fr/projet-pegasus/article/2021/07/19/l-obsession-du-sahara-occidental-pousse-le-maroc-a-tenter-d-espionner-le-maire-d-ivry-sur-seine_6088772_6088648.html'>rejects</a> the consortium’s information on its use of Pegasus. Immediately after the revelations, the state of Morocco sues Amnesty International, Forbidden Stories and several French and German media outlets for defamation. In March 2022, a French court rules that the defamation lawsuits are inadmissible.</p><p>The same month, Amnesty International <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.amnesty.org/fr/latest/news/2022/03/morocco-western-sahara-activist-nso-pegasus/'>reveals</a> that the phones of Saharan human rights activist Aminatou Haidar was infected with Pegasus in November 2021 — that is, four months after the Pegasus Project revelations.</p><p>According to El Español, in May 2022, the European Parliament allegedly <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.elespanol.com/espana/politica/20220512/parlamento-europeo-incluye-marruecos-investigacion-espionaje-pegasus/671683243_0.html'>decided</a> to include Morocco in its newly-launched investigation into the Pegasus scandal.</p>
