            <p>In 2019, The Guardian <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/israeli-spyware-allegedly-used-to-target-pakistani-officials-phones'>reports</a> that the phones of at least two dozen Pakistani government officials were allegedly targeted with Pegasus. The suspected attacks occurred through a vulnerability in the WhatsApp software.</p><p>In July 2021, the Pegasus Project <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/19/india-nso-pegasus/'>reveals</a> that about 1,000 Pakistani numbers, including at least one belonging to Prime Minister Imran Khan, were selected for potential surveillance by an Indian client of NSO Group. Immediately after the revelations, Pakistanâ€™s Information minister <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1636767'>announces</a> that his government will investigate the possible hacking attempt on a mobile phone once used by Khan. Pakistan <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.reuters.com/technology/pakistan-seeks-un-probe-indias-use-pegasus-spyware-2021-07-23/'>calls</a> on the United Nations to investigate the potential use of Pegasus by India against public figures such as Khan.</p>
