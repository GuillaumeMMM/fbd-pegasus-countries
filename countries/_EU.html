            <h1>European Union</h1>
            <p>In July 2021, the day after the Pegasus Project is published, the president of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.dw.com/en/pegasus-spying-reports-completely-unacceptable-says-eus-von-der-leyen/a-58318756'>says</a> that the acts of misuse brought to light by the investigation are “completely unacceptable.”</p><p>During its plenary session in September 2021, the European Parliament <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-09-15-ITM-009_EN.html'>takes</a> up the Pegasus scandal, requesting answers from the Commission and calling for action. European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders declares that the European Union must rapidly legislate to protect the rights of journalists. The media will reveal a few months later that around the time of his declaration, his phone might have been targeted with Pegasus.</p><p>In December 2021, 88 non-governmental organizations and independent experts <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/12/03/joint-letter-urging-eu-targeted-sanctions-against-nso-group'>call</a> on the European Union to impose global sanctions against NSO Group and to ban the purchase, transfer, export and Import of its technologies.</p><p>In February 2022, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/eu-data-watchdog-calls-for-pegasus-spyware-ban'>declares</a> that Pegasus spyware is “incompatible with [the] democratic values [of the EU]” and that it should be banned.</p><p>In March 2022, after allegations that the governments of Poland and of Hungary used Pegasus to spy on their critics, the European Parliament <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/fr/press-room/20220304IPR24801/trois-nouvelles-commissions-pegasus-ingerence-etrangere-et-covid-19'>announces</a> the creation of an inquiry commission on the Pegasus scandal. The commission’s work began in April and should continue for a year. It is to date the most significant decision taken by the European Union on Pegasus in the aftermath of the Pegasus Project.</p><p>In April 2022, Reuters <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-senior-eu-officials-were-targeted-with-israeli-spyware-sources-2022-04-11/'>reveals</a> that at least five senior EU officials were targeted with Pegasus in 2021. Among them is European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders (he did not return Reuters’ messages).</p><p>The same month, NSO Group’s co-founder Shalev Hulio <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/how-democracies-spy-on-their-citizens'>states</a> to The New Yorker that “almost all governments in Europe are using [NSO’s] tools.”</p><p>On May 21, the European Parliament's inquiry commission auditions Chaim Gelfand, a representative of NSO Group. Under fire from members of parliament, he <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.politico.eu/article/pegasus-use-5-eu-countries-nso-group-admit/'>states</a> that at least five European countries had used Pegasus and that NSO Group has terminated the contract with at least one of them. Some of his answers are vague, as a Citizen Lab researcher <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://twitter.com/jsrailton/status/1539237882644267009'>notes</a> on Twitter.</p>
