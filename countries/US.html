            <p>In May 2019, American tech company WhatsApp <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/29/whatsapp-sues-israeli-firm-accusing-it-of-hacking-activists-phones'>discovers</a> that a vulnerability in its messaging app has allowed NSO Group to target over 1,400 mobile phones using Pegasus. With assistance from Citizen Lab, the company <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://citizenlab.ca/2019/10/nso-q-cyber-technologies-100-new-abuse-cases/'>identifies</a> over 100 cases of targeting of human rights activists and journalists in at least 20 countries. According to WhatsApp, an American number <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/10/30/1400-whatsapp-hacks-in-2-weeks--were-you-a-target-of-israeli-spyware/?sh=1095a7383a7c'>is</a> on the list.

In the absence of technical analyses, however, it is impossible to know whether the infection was successful. In an unprecedented stance from a major tech company, WhatsApp openly <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1189250601525399552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1189250601525399552%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fscroll.in%2Flatest%2F942178%2Fisraeli-spyware-used-to-spy-on-indian-journalists-and-activists-confirms-whatsapp'>condemns</a> the incident and <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whatsapp-complaint-against-nso-group/abc0fb24-8090-447f-8493-1e05b2fc1156/'>sues</a> NSO Group in the US for exploiting its platform.

The investigation further <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/20/emmanuel-macron-identified-in-leaked-pegasus-project-data'>reveals</a> that the U.S. number of a U.S. diplomat was on the list (NSO Group said it was made "technically impossible" to deploy Pegasus against U.S. numbers). According to the technical analysis of the investigation, it seems that this number was selected by the government of Morocco (Morocco denies having used Pegasus).</p><p>In response to the Pegasus Project, NSA whistleblower <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/19/edward-snowden-calls-spyware-trade-ban-pegasus-revelations'>Edward</a> Snowden and WhatsApp CEO <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1416794904991211526'>Will Cathcart</a> each call for a global moratorium on the trade and use of international surveillance technology.
