            <p>In May 2019, American tech company WhatsApp <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/29/whatsapp-sues-israeli-firm-accusing-it-of-hacking-activists-phones'>discovered</a> that a vulnerability in its messaging app had allowed NSO Group to target over 1,400 mobile phones using Pegasus. With assistance from Citizen Lab, the company <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://citizenlab.ca/2019/10/nso-q-cyber-technologies-100-new-abuse-cases/'>identified</a> over 100 cases of targeting of human rights activists and journalists in at least 20 countries. According to WhatsApp, an American number <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/10/30/1400-whatsapp-hacks-in-2-weeks--were-you-a-target-of-israeli-spyware/?sh=1095a7383a7c'>was</a> on the list. Judicial documents of the case <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-22-AccessNow-Amicus-Brief13845453.1.pdf'>mentioned</a> that American citizens were on the list. In the absence of technical analyses, however, it is impossible to know whether the infection was successful. In an unprecedented stance from a major tech company, WhatsApp openly <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1189250601525399552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1189250601525399552%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fscroll.in%2Flatest%2F942178%2Fisraeli-spyware-used-to-spy-on-indian-journalists-and-activists-confirms-whatsapp'>condemned</a> the incident and <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whatsapp-complaint-against-nso-group/abc0fb24-8090-447f-8493-1e05b2fc1156/'>sued</a> NSO Group in the US for exploiting its platform. Major tech companies such as Microsoft, Google and LinkedIn <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20433333-nso-v-whatsapp-amicus-brief-microsoft-et-al-as-filed'>filed</a> a legal brief in support of WhatsApp's complaint. (In January 2023, the U.S. supreme court decided that WhatsApp could <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-lets-metas-whatsapp-pursue-pegasus-spyware-suit-2023-01-09/'>pursue</a> its lawsuit against NSO Group.)</p><p>In 2020, Citizen Lab <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://citizenlab.ca/2020/01/stopping-the-press-new-york-times-journalist-targeted-by-saudi-linked-pegasus-spyware-operator/'>revealed</a> the first known case of Pegasus targeting an American citizen: New York Times journalist Ben Hubbard.</p><p>In July 2021, the Pegasus Project <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/07/19/us-phone-numbers-nso/'>identified</a> nearly a dozen foreign numbers of U.S. citizens, including government officials, listed as persons of interest by NSO Group customers. The investigation further <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/20/emmanuel-macron-identified-in-leaked-pegasus-project-data'>revealed</a> that the U.S. number of a U.S. diplomat was on the list (NSO Group said it was "technically impossible" to deploy Pegasus against U.S. numbers). According to the technical analysis of the investigation, it seemed that this number was selected by the government of Morocco (Morocco denied having used Pegasus).</p><p>In response to the Pegasus Project, NSA whistleblower <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/19/edward-snowden-calls-spyware-trade-ban-pegasus-revelations'>Edward</a> Snowden and WhatsApp CEO <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1416794904991211526'>Will Cathcart</a> each called for a global moratorium on the trade and use of international surveillance technology. So too did <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/doc10/4516/2021/en/'>156 civil society organizations and 26 independent experts</a> in a joint open letter to states, as well as <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2021/08/spyware-scandal-un-experts-call-moratorium-sale-life-threatening?LangID=E&NewsID=27379'>UN human rights experts</a>.

On July 26, four prominent US lawmakers jointly <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://malinowski.house.gov/media/press-releases/enough-enough-joint-statement-representatives-tom-malinowski-katie-porter'>issued</a> a statement calling the Biden administration to take action against surveillance companies following the Pegasus Project. On July 29, the White House <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/29/pegasus-white-house-israel-concerns/'>spoke</a> with Israeli officials about spyware concerns. In September, then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2021/09/committee-legal-affairs-and-human-rights-parliamentary-assembly-council-europe?LangID=E&NewsID=27455'>issued</a> a statement to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, Parliamentary Assembly Council of Europe, asking states not only to implement a moratorium on the sale and transfer of surveillance technology, but also to “rein in the surveillance industry.</p><p>In November 2021, the US government <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list'>blacklisted</a> NSO Group.</p><p>The same month, media outlets <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2021/11/24/pegasus-apple-revele-l-existence-de-dizaines-de-nouvelles-victimes-dans-le-monde_6103461_4408996.html'>reported</a> that Apple had revealed the existence of dozens of new victims around the world, who the company had alerted individually.

The Times also <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/magazine/nso-group-israel-spyware.html'>revealed</a> that the CIA had purchased a Pegasus license for the government of Djibouti (Djibouti denied and the CIA declined to comment).</p><p>In February, the members of the Pegasus Project <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/01/nso-offered-us-mobile-security-firm-bags-of-cash-whistleblower-claims'>disclosed</a> that the U.S. Department of Justice had launched a criminal investigation into NSO Group and that a whistleblower had alleged that an NSO Group executive offered “bags of cash” to an US-based mobile security company in exchange for access to a global signaling network used to track mobile phones.</p><p>The New Yorker <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/how-democracies-spy-on-their-citizens'>revealed</a> in April that the Biden Administration was investigating “additional targeting of U.S. officials” and was considering banning the purchase or use of foreign commercial spyware by the U.S. government, or others, if it has been “improperly used abroad.”</p><p>In June, <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/14/nso-group-pegasus-us-l3harris'>The Guardian</a>, <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-06-14/ty-article/.premium/white-house-deeply-concerned-over-any-deal-for-infamous-israeli-spyware-maker-nso/00000181-63a4-d91f-a7d7-73a4a91c0000'>Haaretz</a> and <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/14/l3harris-nso-sale-pegasus/'>The Washington Post</a> reported on discussions between a U.S. defense contractor, L3Harris, and NSO Group about a sale of the latter’s surveillance technology. A White House official said that "such a transaction, if it were to take place, raises serious counterintelligence and security concerns for the US government", which led L3Harris to <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/10/us-defence-firm-ends-talks-to-buy-nso-groups-surveillance-technology'>abandon</a> talks to purchase NSO Group’s surveillance technology, as the three media outlets reported in July.
