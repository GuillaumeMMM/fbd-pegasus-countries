The investigation also finds the phone numbers of two other Khashoggi associates and two senior Turkish officials involved in the investigation into his homicide in the list of potential targets. The same month, the New York Times <a class="fbd-text-button" target="_blank" href='https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/world/middleeast/israel-saudi-khashoggi-hacking-nso.html'>reports</a> that NSO Group sold Pegasus to Saudi Arabia in 2017 and that it had canceled the contract after the assassination of Khashoggi in 2018 but that a new one was signed with the Kingdom in 2019, with the the encouragement of the Israeli state. Overall, the Pegasus project identifies more than 800 numbers likely selected by Saudi Arabia for potential surveillance.</p>
